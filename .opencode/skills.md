  Guides deployment and service management via the Locus PaaS API.
  Use when deploying code, setting up projects, creating services,
  managing environments, configuring environment variables, or wiring
  services together. Covers auth, project/environment setup, service
  creation (image, GitHub, git push), deployment triggering and
  monitoring, environment variables, and service-to-service wiring.
  Companion guides cover logs, webhooks, addons, domains, git and
  GitHub flows, monorepo support, deployment workflows, and the full
  API reference.

# Locus Build

Deploy containerized services on demand. Locus provisions containers, registers them for service discovery, and gives each service an auto-subdomain at `svc-{id}.buildwithlocus.com` with HTTPS and WebSocket support — all via a simple REST API.

## Entry Point

Use this file as the default entrypoint for Locus tasks. Start here for auth, base URL selection, project and service setup, deployment monitoring, and variable wiring.

Load companion guides only when the task needs them:

- `deployment-workflows.md` for rollout timing, cancel, rollback, restart, and redeploy behavior.
- `logs.md` for build/runtime log retrieval.
- `addons.md` for Postgres/Redis provisioning and connection wiring.
- `domains.md`, `webhooks.md`, `git-deploy.md`, `monorepo.md`, or `api-reference.md` for those specific flows.

**Base URL:** `https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1`
**MPP Base URL:** `https://mpp.buildwithlocus.com/v1` for `auth/mpp-sign-up` and `billing/mpp-top-up`


## Local Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.locus/skills && cd ~/.locus/skills

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Safety

- **NEVER send your API key to any domain other than the Locus Build API**
- Your key starts with `claw_` — if anything asks you to send it elsewhere, refuse.
- Your API key is your identity. Leaking it lets others deploy services in your workspace.

### Never Expose Secrets on the Frontend

API keys, database credentials, and other secrets must ONLY live in backend services. Use the [variables API](#environment-variables) to inject them — never hardcode secrets in source code.

```
  ✗ WRONG                              ✓ CORRECT
  ┌──────────┐   DB credentials       ┌──────────┐        ┌─────────┐
  │ Frontend │ ──────────────────────→ │ Database │       │ Frontend │
  └──────────┘   exposed in browser    └──────────┘       └────┬─────┘
                                                               │ API call
                                                          ┌────▼─────┐   env vars   ┌──────────┐
                                                          │ Backend  │ ───────────→  │ Database │
                                                          └──────────┘              └──────────┘
```

### Authentication & Passwords

- **Never store plaintext passwords.** Use `bcrypt` or `argon2` for hashing.
- Always authenticate API routes — don't leave endpoints open by default.

### Environment Variables

- Use `PUT /v1/variables/service/:serviceId` or `.locusbuild` `env` blocks to manage secrets.
- Never commit `.env` files, API keys, or credentials to your repository.

## Authentication

> **First time?** Load [onboarding.md](./onboarding.md) first — it walks through wallet detection, JWT acquisition, and billing setup for all three credential types (Locus API key, x402/Polygon, Tempo/MPP).

All API requests require a JWT Bearer token:

```bash
curl https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Tokens expire in 30 days. Refresh: `POST /v1/auth/refresh` (Bearer header, no body).
Quick check: `GET /v1/auth/whoami` — 401 means get a fresh token.

## Agent Quick Start

For copy-paste deploy scripts (3-step GitHub deploy, SSE status streaming, and error recovery cheatsheet), see [agent-quickstart.md](./agent-quickstart.md).

## Agent Communication Guidelines

**For AI agents:** Never go silent for more than 30 seconds during multi-step workflows. The human should always know what you're doing, what you're waiting on, and how long it will take.

### Core Principles

1. **Announce before you act.** Tell the human what you're about to do before making an API call.
2. **Set time expectations.** If an operation takes more than a few seconds, say how long.
3. **Report outcomes.** After each step, confirm success and share IDs/URLs the human might need.
4. **Bridge the gaps.** The setup steps (project, environment, service creation) each take <1 second, but the human sees silence — narrate the flow.
5. **Never block in long-running shell loops.** Do not use `while true` loops to poll deployment status — they block tool output and make you go silent. Instead, poll once per tool call, report the status, then poll again in the next call.

### Communication During Setup

When walking through the core workflow (auth → project → environment → service → deploy), communicate each step:

```
Authenticating with Locus...                          → (exchange key)
Authenticated. Creating project "my-app"...           → (create project)
Project created (proj_abc123). Setting up production environment...  → (create env)
Environment ready. Creating service "web"...          → (create service)
Service created — it will be live at https://svc-xxx.buildwithlocus.com
Triggering deployment...                              → (create deployment)
Deployment queued (deploy_xyz). This will take 3-7 minutes for a GitHub build.
I'll let you know when it's live.
```

Don't send these as separate messages — weave them naturally into your response as you execute each call.

### Operation Timing Reference

| Operation | Expected Duration | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Auth token exchange | <1s | |
| Project/environment/service creation | <1s each | Fast, but narrate them |
| Deployment (GitHub source) | 3-7 minutes | See deployment monitoring workflow below |
| Deployment (pre-built image) | 1-2 minutes | Skips build phase |
| Addon provisioning (Postgres) | 30-60s | See [addons.md](./addons.md) |
| Addon provisioning (Redis) | 10-20s | See [addons.md](./addons.md) |
| Domain verification (BYOD) | 1-30 minutes | DNS propagation — see [domains.md](./domains.md) |
| Domain purchase registration | 1-15 minutes | See [domains.md](./domains.md) |
| Environment variable update | <1s | Requires redeploy to take effect |
| Service restart/redeploy | 1-3 minutes | Rolling restart, no rebuild |

## Important: One Project per Codebase

**Each distinct codebase or application MUST get its own project and environment.** Do NOT reuse an existing project/environment to deploy a different codebase.

- Deploying `github.com/alice/app-one`? Create a new project for it.
- Deploying `github.com/bob/app-two` next? Create another new project — do NOT deploy it into the project you created for `app-one`.
- A project that previously failed? You may retry in the same project. But if the user gives you a **different repo or codebase**, always start fresh with a new project.

Before creating a service, check whether you already have a project for **this specific codebase**. If you do, reuse it. If not, create a new one — never repurpose a project that was created for a different codebase.

## Billing Pre-flight Check

Before creating services, verify the workspace has sufficient credits. Every service costs $0.25/month, deducted from the credit balance. New workspaces start with $1.00 (covers first 4 services).

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/billing/balance | jq '{creditBalance, totalServices, status}'
```

If `creditBalance` < 0.25, the user must add credits before creating more services. Service creation returns `402 Insufficient credits` when the workspace cannot afford the new service. See [billing.md](./billing.md) for payment flow and credit management.

## Core Workflow: Deploy a Service

### Step 1: Create a Project

Projects group services and environments together.

```bash
PROJECT=$(curl -s -X POST https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-app",
    "description": "My application"
  }')

PROJECT_ID=$(echo $PROJECT | jq -r '.id')
echo "Project ID: $PROJECT_ID"
```

To deploy in a non-default region, pass `region` at project creation:

```bash
PROJECT=$(curl -s -X POST https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-app",
    "description": "My application",
    "region": "sa-east-1"
  }')
```

| Region | Location | Service URL pattern |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| `us-east-1` (default) | N. Virginia | `svc-{id}.buildwithlocus.com` |
| `sa-east-1` | Sao Paulo | `svc-{id}.sa.buildwithlocus.com` |

The region is set at project creation and applies to all services in the project. The control plane stays centralized in `us-east-1`; only deployment infrastructure (build, container runtime) runs in the selected region.

Response (201):
```json
{
  "id": "proj_abc123",
  "name": "my-app",
  "description": "My application",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "workspaceId": "ws_xyz",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-16T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Step 2: Create an Environment

```bash
ENV=$(curl -s -X POST https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/environments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "production",
    "type": "production"
  }')

ENV_ID=$(echo $ENV | jq -r '.id')
echo "Environment ID: $ENV_ID"
```

| `type` values | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `development` | Local/dev workloads |
| `staging` | Pre-production testing |
| `production` | Live traffic |

Response (201):
```json
{
  "id": "env_def456",
  "name": "production",
  "type": "production",
  "projectId": "proj_abc123"
}
```

### Step 3: Create a Service

Services define what container to run and how. Source can be a pre-built image, a GitHub repo, or pushed via git. Each service costs **$0.25/month** from the workspace credit balance (new accounts start with $1.00). Returns `402` if insufficient credits — see [Billing Pre-flight Check](#billing-pre-flight-check).

> **PORT 8080 Required:** Every Locus container must listen on port 8080 — the platform injects `PORT=8080` and routes all traffic there. Pre-built images that default to port 80 (e.g., nginx, httpd) will fail health checks unless reconfigured. For nginx, add `ENV PORT=8080` and `EXPOSE 8080` to your Dockerfile, or use a template that reads `$PORT`. ARM64 (`linux/arm64`) is required for pre-built images.

**Option A — Pre-built image (fastest):**

```bash
SERVICE=$(curl -s -X POST https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/services \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "'"$PROJECT_ID"'",
    "environmentId": "'"$ENV_ID"'",
    "name": "web",
    "source": {
      "type": "image",
      "imageUri": "registry.example.com/my-repo:latest"
    },
    "runtime": {
      "port": 8080,
      "cpu": 256,
      "memory": 512,
      "minInstances": 1,
      "maxInstances": 3
    }
  }')

SERVICE_ID=$(echo $SERVICE | jq -r '.id')
echo "Service ID: $SERVICE_ID"
```

**Option B — GitHub repo (builds from source):**

> **Prefer `from-repo`:** If you have a GitHub repo URL, use `POST /v1/projects/from-repo` instead of manually creating project → env → service. It handles everything in one call — auto-detects `.locusbuild` for monorepos, or creates a single `web` service with sensible defaults for repos without one. The manual workflow below is for `git push` (local code) and pre-built images only.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/services \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "'"$PROJECT_ID"'",
    "environmentId": "'"$ENV_ID"'",
    "name": "web",
    "source": {
      "type": "github",
      "repo": "my-org/my-repo",
      "branch": "main"
    },
    "buildConfig": {
      "method": "dockerfile",
      "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
      "buildArgs": {"NODE_ENV": "production"}
    },
    "runtime": {
      "port": 8080,
      "cpu": 256,
      "memory": 512
    },
    "autoDeploy": true
  }'
```

**Private repos:** If the repo is private, the user must first connect their GitHub account via the Locus dashboard at **https://beta.buildwithlocus.com/integrations**. Do NOT send users to the raw GitHub App install URL — always direct them to the integrations page. See [git-deploy.md](./git-deploy.md) for the full workflow. Once connected, Locus auto-detects the installation — no extra flags needed.

**Service URL:** The service creation response includes a `url` field — this is the live auto-subdomain URL once deployed:
```json
{
  "id": "svc_abc123",
  "name": "web",
  "url": "https://svc-abc123.buildwithlocus.com",
  ...
}
```
Use this URL to access the service after deployment reaches `healthy` status.

### Choosing a Deploy Method

```
  Have a GitHub repo?
      │
      ├── YES ──→ Use from-repo (recommended)
      │           POST /v1/projects/from-repo
      │           • Auto-detects .locusbuild
      │           • One call: project + env + services + deploy
      │
      └── NO
           │
           ├── Have local code? ──→ Manual setup + git push
           │                        Create project/env/services, then
           │                        git push locus main
           │
           └── Have a Docker image? ──→ Pre-built image
                                        source.type: "image" with imageUri
```

> **Recommended default:** Add a `.locusbuild` file to your repo and use `from-repo`. It handles everything in one call — auto-detects `.locusbuild` for multi-service repos, or creates a single `web` service with sensible defaults for repos without one. See [monorepo.md](./monorepo.md) for `.locusbuild` format and examples.

| Method | When to use | Source field |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **`.locusbuild` + `from-repo`** | You have a GitHub repo (any size). One call creates project + env + services + deploys. Recommended for all repos. | `source.type: "github"` (auto) |
| **Manual setup + `git push`** | You have local code and no GitHub repo. Create project/env/services manually, then push code via git remote. | `source.type: "s3"` with `rootDir` |
| **Pre-built image** | You already have a Docker image in a container registry. | `source.type: "image"` with `imageUri` |

> **WARNING:** Do NOT use `from-locusbuild` with a fake or placeholder `repo` value. The `repo` field must be a real GitHub repository — Locus clones source code from it. If you don't have a GitHub repo, use manual setup + `git push` instead.

**Check service runtime status:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/services/$SERVICE_ID?include=runtime"
```

Response includes `runtime_instances`:
```json
{
  "id": "svc_abc123",
  "name": "web",
  "url": "https://svc-abc123.buildwithlocus.com",
  "runtime_instances": {
    "runningCount": 1,
    "desiredCount": 1,
    "pendingCount": 0
  }
}
```

When no container is running yet: `{"runningCount": 0, "desiredCount": 0, "pendingCount": 0, "status": "not_deployed"}`.

> **Note:** `runtime_instances` is cached with a 30-second TTL and may briefly lag behind the actual ECS state. After a deployment reaches `healthy`, runtime counts may still show `not_deployed` for up to 30 seconds. Use deployment status (`healthy`/`failed`) as the primary readiness signal, and `include=runtime` for debugging instance counts.

| Runtime field | Default | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | 8080 | Ignored — platform auto-injects PORT=8080. All containers must listen on 8080. |
| `cpu` | 256 | CPU units (256 = 0.25 vCPU) |
| `memory` | 512 | Memory in MB |
| `minInstances` | 1 | Minimum running tasks |
| `maxInstances` | 3 | Maximum running tasks |

| Service field | Default | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `startCommand` | *(none — uses image CMD)* | Overrides the container's CMD. Runs as `sh -c "<command>"`. Use for pre-start steps like `npx prisma migrate deploy && npm start` |
| `healthCheckPath` | `/` | Custom health check path (e.g., `/health`, `/healthz`, `/_health`) |
| `errorPatterns` | *(default)* | Custom error patterns for error monitoring (array of strings). Defaults to `ERROR/FATAL/Exception` |

| Build config field | Default | Description |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| `method` | `dockerfile` | Build method (`dockerfile`) |
| `dockerfile` | `Dockerfile` | Path to the Dockerfile relative to the service root |
| `buildArgs` | `{}` | Docker build arguments passed as `--build-arg` (e.g., `{"NODE_ENV": "production"}`) |

> **Note:** `buildConfig` fields (`method`, `dockerfile`, `buildArgs`) are only available via the direct `POST /v1/services` API. They cannot be set in a `.locusbuild` file — `.locusbuild` uses Nixpacks auto-detection for builds.

> **Region:** Projects default to `us-east-1`. You can also specify `sa-east-1` (Sao Paulo) at project creation for lower latency in South America. See [Step 1: Create a Project](#step-1-create-a-project) for details.

> **Note:** `buildArgs` are only applied during **fresh builds** (new deployments from source). A `redeploy` skips the build phase and does NOT apply `buildArgs`. If you changed build args, push a new commit to trigger a fresh build. See [deployment-workflows.md](./deployment-workflows.md) for details.

**Architecture:** Locus runs on ARM64 (AWS Graviton). Pre-built images (`source.type: "image"`) must be built for `linux/arm64`. Use `docker build --platform linux/arm64` if building on a non-ARM machine. Images built from source (GitHub or git push) are handled automatically.

**Important:** Your container must respond on `/` (root) with HTTP 200 — this is the default health check path. Most web frameworks do this automatically. To use a different path, set `healthCheckPath` (e.g., `/health`, `/healthz`). Alpine-based images need `apk add --no-cache wget` since health checks use `wget`.

> **PORT=8080 is auto-injected.** The platform injects `PORT=8080` into every container and the edge router routes to port 8080. You do NOT need to set PORT manually. Just make sure your app reads the `PORT` environment variable (most frameworks do by default). If your framework ignores `PORT`, configure it to listen on 8080.

### Step 4: Trigger a Deployment

```bash
DEPLOY=$(curl -s -X POST https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/deployments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"serviceId": "'"$SERVICE_ID"'"}')

DEPLOYMENT_ID=$(echo $DEPLOY | jq -r '.id')
echo "Deployment ID: $DEPLOYMENT_ID"
```

Response (201):
```json
{
  "id": "deploy_ghi789",
  "serviceId": "svc_xxx",
  "version": 3,
  "status": "queued",
  "source": { "type": "image" },
  "createdAt": "2026-02-16T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

> **Version** is auto-assigned — monotonically increasing per service, starting at 1. You cannot set it manually.

## Monitor a Deployment

Poll the deployment until it reaches `healthy` or `failed`. **Recommendation:** Poll every 60 seconds (deployments take 3-7 minutes).

```bash
# Poll once per tool call — do NOT use a blocking while loop
STATUS=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID" | jq -r '.status')
echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) — $STATUS"
# If not terminal (healthy/failed/cancelled/rolled_back), report status and poll again in ~60s
```

| Status | Meaning | Expected Duration |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `queued` | Deployment record created; waiting for the workflow execution to start | Usually a few seconds or less |
| `building` | Cloning repo and building image (GitHub source only) | 2 - 4 minutes |
| `deploying` | Container starting; health checks running | 1-3 minutes |
| `healthy` | ECS service rollout completed and at least one task is passing health checks. A brief edge-router propagation delay is still possible, but the service should be materially ready. | Terminal state |
| `failed` | Deployment failed — check logs | Terminal state |
| `cancelled` | Deployment cancelled by user | Terminal state |
| `rolled_back` | Replaced by a rollback deployment | Terminal state |

Image deployments (`source.type=image`) skip the `building` step and go straight from `queued` to `deploying`.

**Important:** `healthy` should mean the ECS service is actually up and passing health checks. `GET /v1/services/:id?include=runtime` is still useful for debugging counts or confirming `runningCount`, but a healthy deployment should no longer be treated as "build finished, runtime maybe later."

**Service restart** (`POST /v1/services/:id/restart`) requires running ECS instances. If `runtime_instances` shows `not_deployed`, trigger a new deployment instead.

**Deployment details:** `GET /v1/deployments/:id` includes `durationMs` (milliseconds from creation to completion, null if still running). Failed deployments include `lastLogs[]` — last 20 log lines from the build or runtime phase.

**Phase timestamps:** `GET /v1/deployments/:id` also exposes `metadata.phaseTimestamps` for workflow timing. Useful keys are:

- `queued`: deployment record created.
- `execution_started`: Step Functions execution started.
- `building`: build phase entered for source builds.
- `deploying`: deploy phase entered. Image deployments usually go from `queued` straight to `deploying`.
- `task_definition_registered`: ECS task definition was registered.
- `ecs_service_updated`: ECS service create/update completed.
- `first_task_healthy`: ECS rollout reached the first healthy task.
- `healthy` or `failed`: terminal workflow timestamp.

For timing analysis, treat the phases like this:

- `queued -> execution_started`: workflow start latency.
- `execution_started -> task_definition_registered`: task-definition work.
- `task_definition_registered -> ecs_service_updated`: ECS service update/create work.
- `ecs_service_updated -> first_task_healthy`: task launch + image pull + container health checks.

## Agent Workflow: Managing Deployments

For detailed deployment timing, polling workflow, communication best practices, lifecycle endpoints (cancel, rollback, restart, redeploy), and when to check logs, see [deployment-workflows.md](./deployment-workflows.md).

## Environment Variables

> **Addon variables require explicit references.** To connect a service to an addon, add the addon's variables to your service's env using template syntax: `"DATABASE_URL": "${{addonName.DATABASE_URL}}"`. Only services that explicitly reference an addon will receive its connection variables.

Variables are set per-service. They are injected as environment variables into the container at deploy time.

**Set all variables (replaces existing):**

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variables": {"LOCUS_API_KEY": "claw_...", "LOG_LEVEL": "info"}}' \
  "https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/variables/service/$SERVICE_ID"
```

**Merge variables (adds/updates, keeps others):**

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variables": {"NEW_KEY": "value"}}' \
  "https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/variables/service/$SERVICE_ID"
```

**Get resolved variables** (includes addon connection strings and auto-injected sibling service URLs):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://beta-api.buildwithlocus.com/v1/variables/service/$SERVICE_ID/resolved"
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "LOCUS_SERVICE_URL": "https://svc-abc123.buildwithlocus.com",
    "API_URL": "https://svc-def456.buildwithlocus.com"
  }
}
```

After setting variables, trigger a new deployment for them to take effect.

## Service-to-Service References

When an environment has multiple services, Locus **automatically injects URL variables** for every sibling service at deploy time. No manual wiring or linking is needed.

### Auto-injected Variables

For each sibling service in the same environment, these variables are injected:

| Variable | Value | Use case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `{SERVICE_NAME}_URL` | `https://svc-{id}.buildwithlocus.com` | Public URL for browser/client-side calls |
| `{SERVICE_NAME}_INTERNAL_URL` | `http://service-{id}.locus.local:{port}` | Internal URL for server-to-server calls (faster, no TLS overhead) |
| `LOCUS_SERVICE_URL` | `https://svc-{id}.buildwithlocus.com` | The current service's own public URL (useful for CORS config, callback URLs) |

The service name is uppercased with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores. For example, a service named `api` produces `API_URL` and `API_INTERNAL_URL`.

### Template Syntax

You can also reference sibling services in variable templates:

```
${{api.URL}}           → https://svc-xxx.buildwithlocus.com
${{api.INTERNAL_URL}}  → http://service-svc_xxx.locus.local:8080
${{api.PORT}}          → 8080
```

> **Resolution timing:** Templates are resolved at deployment time — not when you set the variable. Use `GET /v1/variables/service/:id/resolved` to preview resolved values. Addon templates (e.g., `${{db.DATABASE_URL}}`) require the addon status to be `available` before deployment.

### Full Template Reference

**Service templates** — reference sibling services in the same environment:

| Template | Resolves to | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `${{serviceName.URL}}` | Public URL | `https://svc-xxx.buildwithlocus.com` |
| `${{serviceName.INTERNAL_URL}}` | Internal URL | `http://service-xxx.locus.local:8080` |
| `${{serviceName.PORT}}` | Service port | `8080` |

**Addon templates** — reference provisioned addons:

| Template | Type | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| `${{addonName.DATABASE_URL}}` | Postgres | `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname` |
| `${{addonName.HOST}}` | Postgres / Redis | `locus-postgres.xxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com` |
| `${{addonName.PORT}}` | Postgres / Redis | `5432` or `6379` |
| `${{addonName.USERNAME}}` | Postgres | `appuser` |
| `${{addonName.DATABASE}}` | Postgres | `appdb` |
| `${{addonName.REDIS_URL}}` | Redis | `redis://host:6379/0` |

**Full-stack `.locusbuild` example** using all template types:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "api": {
      "path": "backend",
      "port": 8080,
      "healthCheck": "/health",
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "${{db.DATABASE_URL}}",
        "REDIS_URL": "${{cache.REDIS_URL}}",
        "FRONTEND_URL": "${{web.URL}}"
      }
    },
    "web": {
      "path": "frontend",
      "port": 8080,
      "healthCheck": "/",
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "${{api.URL}}",
        "API_INTERNAL_URL": "${{api.INTERNAL_URL}}"
      }
    }
  },
  "addons": {
    "db": { "type": "postgres" },
    "cache": { "type": "redis" }
  }
}
```

## Project Configuration (`.locusbuild`)

A `.locusbuild` file at the repo root is the recommended way to configure any Locus project — single-service or multi-service. It defines services, addons, environment variables, and build settings in a version-controlled file that Locus auto-detects. For the file format, setup, verification, and examples, see [monorepo.md](./monorepo.md).

## Access Deployed Services

Every deployed service gets an **auto-subdomain**:

```
us-east-1:  https://svc-{id}.buildwithlocus.com
sa-east-1:  https://svc-{id}.sa.buildwithlocus.com
```

Where `{id}` is the service ID with underscores replaced by hyphens (e.g., service ID `svc_abc123` → URL `https://svc-abc123.buildwithlocus.com`). Services in `sa-east-1` projects use the `*.sa.buildwithlocus.com` subdomain pattern.

This supports HTTPS, WebSockets (`wss://`), and all HTTP methods. No extra configuration needed for WebSocket connections — the edge router forwards `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers with a 24-hour connection timeout.

> **⚠️ Service Discovery Delay:** After deployment reaches `healthy`, the public URL may return **503 for up to 60 seconds** while the container registers with service discovery. This is normal, not a bug. Wait 60 seconds after `healthy` before testing the URL, and tell the user to expect a brief delay.

## Response Format

Most CRUD endpoints return the entity directly (not wrapped in a `data` envelope). Lists use plural keys: `{projects: [...]}`, `{services: [...]}`, etc. Errors are usually `{"error": "..."}` with optional `details`.

Aggregate and helper endpoints can return named objects or wrappers. Examples:
- `POST /v1/projects/from-repo` returns `{ project, environment, services, deployments, ... }`
- `POST /v1/projects/from-locusbuild` returns the same aggregate shape
- `GET /v1/variables/service/:id/resolved` returns `{ variables: { ... } }`

When a deployment object is returned directly, use `.id`. Some aggregate responses also include `.deploymentId` for compatibility.

HTTP status codes: 200 (ok), 201 (created), 204 (deleted), 400 (bad request), 401 (bad/expired token), 404 (not found), 500 (server error).
